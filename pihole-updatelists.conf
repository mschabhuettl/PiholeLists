; by hovering mouse cursor over group name field on the 'Group management' page
;GROUP_ID=0

; Makes sure entries have the specified group assigned on each run
; This does not prevent you from assigning more groups through the web interface
; but can remove entries from the default group if GROUP_ID is negative number
; Do not enable this when you're running multiple different configs
;PERSISTENT_GROUP=false

; Prevent touching entries not created by this script by comparing comment field
; When disabled any user-created entry will be disabled
;REQUIRE_COMMENT=true

; Update gravity after lists are updated? (runs `pihole updateGravity`)
; When disabled invokes lists reload instead
; Set to 'null' to do nothing
;UPDATE_GRAVITY=true

; Vacuum database at the end? (runs `VACUUM` SQLite command)
; Will cause additional writes to disk
;VACUUM_DATABASE=false

;VERBOSE=false

; Show debug messages for troubleshooting purposes
;DEBUG=false

; Maximum time in seconds one list download can take before giving up
; You should increase this when downloads fail because of timeout

;IGNORE_DOWNLOAD_FAILURE=false

; Location of gravity.db file in case you need to change it

; Process lockfile to prevent multiple instances of the script from running
; You shouldn't change it - unless `/var/lock` is unavailable
;LOCK_FILE="/var/lock/pihole-updatelists.lock"

;GIT_BRANCH="master"
